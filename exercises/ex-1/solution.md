## Task 1

```
Requirements for a successful machine vision application: explain important factors using two different points of view: product developer’s point of view and the end user’s point of view.
```

### Product developer
- Fast - should work in real time.
- Accurate/Reliable - assist/replace human vision.
- Not to expensive - return of investments.
- Easy to implement.

### End user:
- Same as for product developer.
- Easy to use.
- Think of who is expected user.

## Task 2

```
Fundamental steps in a machine vision system: explain wh
-ich kind of vision (imaging, image processing and image analysis) would be important and necessary in the implementation of one specific machine vision application. As an application example you use any of the examples we have met in the lectures. You may select also other examples and consider the requirements for that.
```

As an example let's consider empty bottle inspection, reusable glass containers.

- Imaging - it's obviously important part of the system. To find defects
on the bottle. We should use good sensor and proper light.

- Image processing - remove motion blur, bottle texture.

- Image analysis - core of the system; Algorithm that finds cracks and defects.

## Task 3

```
Current research topics in the field: find a recent (this year) issue of a scientific journal in the field (e.g. Machine Vision and Applications), and give a summary about the topics in this one issue.
```

Machine Vision and Applications:
- Glasses on faces recognition based on robust
- Comparative study of image feature detectors and descriptors
- Cell contours of phytoplankton images
- Grain size assessment through bipolar area morphology
- Deformable image registration based on elastodynamics
- Visual tracking in complex scene through pixel-wise tri-modeling
- Fores species recognition based on dynamic classifier selection
- Gaze direction estimation by component separation


## Task 4
```
Current research topics in the field: find a recent (this year) conference in the field (e.g. Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA), ICPR, ICIP), and give a summary about topics (tracks, sessions, etc.).
```

Machine Vision and Applications:
- Image annotation via deep neural network.
- Beyond thinking in common categories: Predicting obstacle vulnerability using large random codebooks.
- Part-segmented features for articulated pose estimation.
- An innovative of pyramid-based fusion for generating the HDR images in common display devices.
- Computer vision-based approach for rite description in old societies. 3D scenes of sites.
